# TarkovAutoSettings

A simple console app for automatically applying display settings when a certain application becomes a foreground application.

Preconfigured for Escape From Tarkov, but config options allow for any application to be configured.

## TODO:

- RegisterHotKey some key that would allow enable/disable/pause on demand.
